/**
 * This is the class that identifies all the actions that are performed by the mouse;
 * It implements MouseListener and MouseMotionListener which contains the methods:
 * mousePressed(), mouseReleased(), and mouseMoved();
 * These methods run every time an action is performed by the mouse regardless of what is happening on the game;
 * Other methods are provided (line 62 to 80), but the game is not going to make use of them;
